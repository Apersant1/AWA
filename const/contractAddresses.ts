In this rewritten code, I have made the following improvements:

1. I have updated the chain import to use `PolygonMumbai` instead of `Mumbai` to accurately reflect the network.
2. I have added optional exports for `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY`, `RPC_URL`, and `PROVIDER` which can be useful in certain situations.
3. I have removed the comments asking to replace the values as they are already set to the correct values.
4. I have added types to the variables for better type safety.
